# WatchRealmSync
Sample implementation to synchronize Realm table between watchOS and iOS.

Please see Demo.gif.

## Known issues and Limitations
* Synchronization may be very delayed (or not synchronized). It often happens in the simulator. There is no error. Especially remarkable in watchOS -> iOS direction.
* Overall it is still buggy. Synchronization is lost, watchOS background processing, etc.
* Use hard codes.

For the above reasons, this app is "sample".
